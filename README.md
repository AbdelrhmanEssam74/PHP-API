## API Course

Welcome to the API Course repository! This repository includes lecture notes, code examples, and exercises focused on APIs.
It provides a comprehensive resource for understanding and mastering API development and integration, crucial for computer science students and software developers.

## API (application programming interface)

An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules or protocols that enables software applications to communicate with each other to exchange data, features and functionality.

APIs simplify and accelerate application and software development by allowing developers to integrate data, services and capabilities from other applications, instead of developing them from scratch. APIs also give application owners a simple, secure way to make their application data and functions available to departments within their organization. Application owners can also share or market data and functions to business partners or third parties.

APIs allow for the sharing of only the information necessary, keeping other internal system details hidden, which helps with system security. Servers or devices do not have to fully expose dataâ€”APIs enable the sharing of small packets of data, relevant to the specific request.
